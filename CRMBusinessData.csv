I re-iterated my last conversation with him, and he accepts he can't upgrade now, just isn't happy about it. O2 advised if he was on simo he could have a handset on refresh alongside but not as its with us. He is going to write a letter of complaint as he's just unhappy but theres nothing else I can do for him, I can't even do a cancel redo as he's beyond 6 months. Thanks Joe Sam Buttery posted on 09 Feb 2018 at 11:21: Resolved Hi Joe I know you spoke to this customer on Wednesday but he has now made a complaint to the network. Could you give him a call and let Will know the outcome please. Thanks x Sam Buttery posted on 09 Feb 2018 at 11:21: Resolved Complaint email from O2 - Feels mis-sold. States was told had to have SIMO as O2 no longer provide phones. Now needs a phone but being told to go to apple and buy one outright - want's to pay monthly for it like previously. Sam Buttery posted on 05 Feb 2018 at 12:43: Resolved Hi Joe This customer has called in as he wants a handset - he wants to know best options on purchasing one. He is on a simo with us and I have advised we cannot upgrade until month 12 and he understands. Not sure if you want to try and sell one off GAN or advise him of the best way to purchase.
